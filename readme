Algoritmi paraleli și distribuiți

I. Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a text processing
algorithm to count word frequencies in a large text file. The
main goal is to explore how we can parallelize the word
counting process to enhance the efficiency when dealing with
large-scale text data.

II. Description

1. Sequential word counting (countWordsSequential)
-reads the entire text file word by word and counts the
frequency
-unordered_map (words = kyes, freq = value)
-processes file sequentially, reads line by line and updates
the word in a single thread

2. Parallel word counting (countWordsParallel)
-reads the entire file into an array (dynamic vector) and
counts word frequencies in parallel using OpenMP
-text split into multiple chunks, each chunk processed by a
different thread

-unordered_map used for each thread to store the word
count for the respective chunk
-speeds up the word count process

3. Main()
-calls either sequential or parallel
-prints word count results

Overall,

Language: C++
Frameworks/System features: C++ STL (data structures like
maps, vectors), OpenMP(parallelized calculation, frozen),
Chrono (time specifications)

III. Results || Execution time:

--sequential
--parallel

separate, parallel is usually (or normally faster than sequential)

Note! This can differ because of possible bottleneck (critical
section declaration) but it’s otherwise fine.

Moreover, with memory allocation &amp; consumption:

--secvential
--parallel

getMemoryUsage()
-returns the memory usage of the current process in kilobytes
