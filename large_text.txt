This is a sample text file to test word frequency counting. It contains repeated words and some unique words.

C++ is a powerful language. C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. OpenMP enables parallel computing in C++.

Parallel computing can improve performance in large-scale applications. However, debugging parallel programs can be challenging.

Multithreading and multiprocessing are different approaches to parallel execution.

Boost and OpenMP are popular frameworks for parallel processing. The STL provides useful data structures for text processing tasks.

This file is large enough to simulate word frequency analysis.
